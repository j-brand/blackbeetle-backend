# blackbeetle.de API

## blackbeetle.de

Blackbeetle is a small private website project that I started before my trip to Australia. In order to keep my family and friends up to date without sending everyone the same messages over and over again, I set up this little travel blog. The project has changed a lot over time. Whenever I try out a new technology, Blackbeetle is my test object. Initially, the entire page was implemented with Laravel framework. Later I redesigned the front end in VueJs. At the moment the project is pretty messy, but I hope it gets better. I am currently in the process of setting up the administration interface with Angular.

## The API

The API delivers and receives data from the front end. 
It also generates image variants, sends emails and takes care of authentication.
This is where the magic happens...
